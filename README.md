## Hi there, it's Yashar! 👋
I'm Yashar Zafari, a Robotics Student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), interested in the fields of Autonomous Robots, Control, Swarm Robotics, Drones, and CNC Machining.

### Me and Robotics
“A man’s mind stretched by new ideas may never return to its original dimensions.” As a child, my mind was stretched by the fascinating world of robotics. I regularly watched cartoons with robot characters and sneaked into my father's room to skim through advanced Mechatronics and Robotics books. While I couldn't comprehend the academic details at the time, I was captivated by the sense of wonder and possibility.

That early spark of enthusiasm set me on the path I remain on today. My passion for building and programming robots continues to be driven by the thrill of bringing to life what were once abstract ideas. My mindset has been fundamentally expanded by everything I've learned and created. And yet, I know there are so many more horizons to reach as technology and innovation accelerate. I look forward to having my mind stretched repeatedly as I pursue my career in this dynamic field. For now, I remain as enthusiastic as that curious kid, eager to create and discover.
